This repository contains the MATLAB (c) code that implements the _MFCF_ algorithm described in the following publications:

 - Massara, Guido Previde, and Tomaso Aste. "Learning clique forests." _arXiv preprint arXiv:1905.02266_ (2019).
 - Previde Massara, Guido. "Building Information Filtering Networks with Topological Constraints: Algorithms and Applications." PhD diss., UCL (University College London), 2020.

The _MFCF_ algorithm, as implemented here, has been applied to problems concerning portfolio and risk management here:

 - Aste, Tomaso. "Topological regularization with information filtering networks." _arXiv preprint arXiv:2005.04692_ (2020).
 - Aste, Tomaso. "Stress testing and systemic risk measures using multivariate conditional probability." Available at SSRN 3575512 (2020). 

A version of the algorithm has been implemented in the R (C) programming language and is available in Dr. Alex Christensen's _NetworkToolbox_:

 - Christensen, Alexander P. "NetworkToolbox: Methods and Measures for Brain, Cognitive, and Psychometric Network Analysis in R." R J. 10, no. 2 (2018): 422.
